The dataset includes 1248 images.
People are annotated in YOLOv8 format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 640x640 (Fill (with center crop))
* Auto-contrast via contrast stretching

The following augmentation was applied to create 7 versions of each source image:
* Random rotation of between -9 and +9 degrees
* Random shear of between -10째 to +10째 horizontally and -10째 to +10째 vertically
* Salt and pepper noise was applied to 0.77 percent of pixels

The following transformations were applied to the bounding boxes of each image:
* Random exposure adjustment of between -10 and +10 percent

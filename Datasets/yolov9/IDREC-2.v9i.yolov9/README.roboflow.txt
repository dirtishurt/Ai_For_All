The dataset includes 1114 images.
People are annotated in YOLOv9 format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 640x640 (Fit within)
* Auto-contrast via contrast stretching

The following augmentation was applied to create 7 versions of each source image:
* Random rotation of between -9 and +9 degrees
* Random shear of between -10째 to +10째 horizontally and -10째 to +10째 vertically
* Salt and pepper noise was applied to 0.18 percent of pixels

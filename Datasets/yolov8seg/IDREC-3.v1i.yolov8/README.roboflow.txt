The dataset includes 1402 images.
People-iR6q are annotated in YOLOv8 format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 640x640 (Fit within)

The following augmentation was applied to create 7 versions of each source image:
* Random rotation of between -9 and +9 degrees
* Random shear of between -10° to +10° horizontally and -10° to +10° vertically
* Salt and pepper noise was applied to 0.18 percent of pixels
